# Non-negative-matrix-factorization-NMF-
I have been interested in NMF technique both on a theoretical level as well as regard of its practical implementation through its various applications, related algorithmic methods and variants. In particular, I present a concrete application of NMF in chemometrics, more precisely in spectrometrics, for which we are interested in spectral unmixing. The dataset on which I carry out my study is retrieved from the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Standard reference database number 69 (Linstrom and Mallard, 2017) of the NIST Chemistry WebBook, and available on http://webbook.nist.gov.
